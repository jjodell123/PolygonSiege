# PolygonSiege: Made in high school
PLEASE NOTE: This was made in high school (and is actually the first game I made), and this was also before I realized code style and documentation were important.

This is a game based on clash of clans that I made my freshman year of high school. The player gets gladiators and tanks to try to take down a base.
